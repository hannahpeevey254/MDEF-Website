## Welcome to my website.

I’m Hannah Peevey, currently pursuing my Master’s in Design for Emergent Futures at the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC). Through the MDEF program, I’m seeking to develop a framework that brings structure to my creative practice and helps me translate imaginative concepts into tangible realities.

My background is in Architecture and Design, which has fundamentally reshaped how I perceive and experience the world. Design has expanded my understanding of how our surroundings influence daily life — and how thoughtful creation can reimagine those interactions.

I’m driven to challenge the boundaries of sustainable design and explore innovative solutions that enhance everyday experiences through spaces, objects, and systems
