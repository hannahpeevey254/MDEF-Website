# Project 1 - Design Bet  
On our first week of MDEF we were asked "What is your research interest?"

I found this question to be equally as scary as someone asking you "what do you want to be when you grow up?", "who are you as a designer?","why dont you use your architecture degree?"


**What did I do** I went through my six essays I had written when applying to multiple graduate schools and , with the help of chat gbt, I found one common denominator. 

**TO SHAPE THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE**

    - Creating moments that often go unnoticed yet define the quality of our lives - experiences that linger - a space, a texture, or an interaction that feels personal and alive -

## 🧭 Reflection
Through these prototypes, I explored how digital systems shape emotional transparency — asking where the line between comfort and exposure lies.  
Next, I aim to connect this to **wearable design** and **sensor-based interaction** for my master project.
