## ★ Narratives 1

**Proposition:**  
For my personal narrative, I envision an interactive book that acts as a visual and conceptual exploration of my work. It will be bright, colorful, and engaging, designed to attract attention and invite interaction rather than passive viewing. The book functions almost like a flipbook, guiding the reader through fragments of ideas while gradually revealing connections across projects, themes, and moments of inspiration that have emerged throughout the semester.

The content will be broken into parts, with intentional moments where my ideas fully unfold for those interested in understanding where they came from and how they evolved. Instead of presenting a linear or resolved outcome, the book exposes the entire process in an unconventional way, allowing gaps, shifts, and overlaps to remain visible as part of the narrative.
