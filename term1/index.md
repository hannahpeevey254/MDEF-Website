# Term 2

Welcome to my Term 2 portfolio page.  
This term focuses on **experimentation, prototyping, and iteration** — exploring how design, data, and technology shape our senses and behavior.

## 🧭 Reflection
Through these prototypes, I explored how digital systems shape emotional transparency — asking where the line between comfort and exposure lies.  
Next, I aim to connect this to **wearable design** and **sensor-based interaction** for my master project.
