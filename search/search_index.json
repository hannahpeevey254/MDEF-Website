In the first week, we disassembled, cataloged, and examined the inner workings of a discarded device. In the second week, we reassembled the components into a new hybrid system\u2014repurposing the original parts with a completely new intention. For our group, we chose the vintage SUNSTECH RD-1010 radio. The radio still functioned perfectly when we found it, and we wanted to give it a new life by transforming its internal logic into an interactive e Where We Started We began by carefully opening the radio, unscrewing the back panel and working layer by layer through the internal structure. Our goal was to remove the boards without damaging any components, since we planned to reuse the control logic in our final prototype. The process was exciting; each layer revealed new parts, materials, and unexpected learning curves for our team. Key steps in the teardown: Unscrewing and removing the back casing. Disconnecting internal boards safely to preserve functionality. Documenting each component and its behavior. Identifying reusable sensors, conductors, amplifiers, and mechanical parts. Below is the forensic report we created, documenting every part and its specific role within the system. We transformed the radio\u2019s original capacitive touch board into a digital controller. We repurposed the capacitive touch sensor panel from the vintage radio and connected it to an Arduino so we could manipulate the touch-based signals. The original board had six sensor pads on the left that were designed to change radio settings when touched, and nine sensors on the right that controlled the clock functions. To interface this with our computer, we soldered wires from selected touch pads on the radio\u2019s PCB to the numbered input pins on the Arduino. Each wire acted as its own input, and each channel was programmed to output a different beat or frequency whenever it was touched\u2014turning the pads into touch-activated musical controls. Our goal for next week is to manipulate or reinterpret the music originally played by the radio by using its touch sensor panel as a modern interactive interface. With the Arduino receiving touch data, we sent these signals over USB into our computer and used them in TouchDesigner to drive real-time visual effects.

Zine THE JOY KILLER Made with the SUNSTECH RPRD3000 Introduction We transformed the vintage SUNSTECH radio into a reimagined way of playing with the childrens toy, \"Jack in the Box\". The intention behind the design was to expose the hdden truth behnd the magic of Christmas. Video link: click here for link How did we make it? Through lots of trial and error. Many Prototypes. Lots of Hope. Countless failures. Heres the procress. \u2605 our prototypes \u2605 When designing the scissor mechanism, we struggled with making the collapsed structure narrow enough to fit inside the box while still giving it enough room to move. The box was only 9 cm tall, so the mechanism had to fully collapse to hide the clown, yet still extend with enough strength and height to push the clown completely out of the box, just like a traditional jack-in-the-box. This particular one failed because it only collapsed to 4cm, but we also needed room for the controlled motor and the clown to fit. So our way of reconstructing this was to minimize the structure down to 5 parts. document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function () { $(\"#book\").turn({ width: 800, height: 500, autoCenter: true, display: \"double\", // \u2190 two-page layout gradients: true, // nice shading effect elevation: 50 // stronger page flip realism }); }); .page { background-color: #cbcaccff; padding: 20px; box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0,0,0,.15); font-family: sans-serif; } <style> .page-img { max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; width: 100%; /* fills the page width, but... */ height: auto; /* ...maintains aspect ratio */ object-fit: contain; /* prevents overflow in any direction */ display: block; } Reflection The second week pushed us even further as we moved from electronic sensing into mechanical storytelling. Transforming the preserved electronics into a \u201cJack-in-the-Box\u201d style toy required us to combine sound, movement, timing, and physical constraints inside a box that was never meant to house any of it. Designing scissor mechanisms, calculating collapse heights, and troubleshooting gear systems made the process messy and often frustrating\u2014but also incredibly rewarding. Every prototype taught us something new about force, friction, tolerances, and how sensitive physical systems can be when scaled down. If I were to redo this project, I would simplify the mechanical concept. Instead of creating a complex gear system squeezed into the tight constraints of the radio box, I would return to the elegance of the original jack-in-the-box mechanism: a spring-based system with a simple open-and-close trigger for the lid. This would have honored the original play logic while allowing us to focus more deeply on the electronic interaction and storytelling.

Using OpenAI\u2019s Agent Builder we first attempted to connect curated playlists through Zapier. Due to technical difficulties integrating Zapier as an API within the agent workflow we decided to rely entirely on OpenAI agents. We built a three agent system. The first was a light measuring agent connected to the LDR through MCP. It was prompted to provide the light condition of the room. The second was a weather agent which used the web search tool to retrieve the current weather conditions in Barcelona. This data was combined with the light data from the previous agent. The third was a music recommendation agent. It used both the weather and light information to suggest a song. The agent referenced an MIT study linking temperature changes to mood and selected a track that could act as a mood stabilizer. When the system ran it first detected the light level in the room. It then combined that information with real time weather data from Barcelona. The final output was a song recommendation intended to stabilize mood in relation to the surrounding environment. --- Reflection. If we were to continue or expand this project I would want to move it toward a community based system. Instead of operating only at an individual level the system could use phone geolocation to assign the same Spotify playlist to everyone within a defined radius. This shared musical output would respond to weather and environmental conditions with the goal of stabilizing the collective mood of an urban area. This approach would allow the project to shift from a personal experience to a study of how sound weather and environment interact at a city scale.

Our project explores how biological rhythms can become part of domestic infrastructure, rather than something measured, optimized, or hidden. Coming from different research backgrounds \u2014 macrobiotic therapy and symbiotic organs, biometric data and AI, and speculative thinking on future domestic infrastructures \u2014 we were interested in how care, regulation, and meaning might be re-embedded in intimate, embodied systems. We began by asking how internal physiological processes, such as a heartbeat, could be externalized in a way that feels relational rather than extractive. Instead of treating biometric data as something to be quantified or controlled, we wanted to translate it into a form that is perceivable, atmospheric, and emotionally legible. The project takes the form of a wearable, organ-like earpiece that senses the wearer\u2019s pulse and translates this biometric data into light. The heartbeat is captured through a pulse sensor, interpreted locally using AI-supported logic, and expressed as a rhythmic light pattern. Rather than visualizing data numerically, the system renders bodily rhythm as light, allowing internal states to modulate atmosphere instead of appearing on screens. Materially, the electronics are embedded in biotic skin made from bacterial cellulose. This living material situates the device between organism and artefact, introducing time, care, and fragility into the system. The earpiece functions as a soft, symbiotic organ \u2014 neither fully internal nor external \u2014 that extends the body into its surroundings. Together, light, biometric data, AI interpretation, and biotic material form a distributed, embodied infrastructure. The project proposes an alternative vision of domestic systems: not centralized, invisible, or automated, but intimate, responsive, and grounded in biological rhythms. In this way, the work brings our different research perspectives into a single speculative artefact that explores how future infrastructures of care might operate through attunement rather than control. Personal Reflection of Week 1. Cognitive Traces. A key moment where our thinking shifted occurred when the heart rate sensor was functioning, the solenoid was close to working, and the overall system design was coming together. At this stage we realized that the electromagnetic fields generated by the solenoid were not going to produce the visual outcome we had originally imagined. Even if the solenoid functioned correctly, it would not create the magnetic image we envisioned on the petri dish. With more time or different resources this might have been possible, but in that moment it became clear that the technical success of the system did not guarantee the conceptual result we were aiming for. As a result we decided to move away from the solenoid and Raspberry Pi Pico setup and instead translate the pulse sensor data through an LED light strip. Moral Traces. The distribution of work within the group functioned well throughout the week. Each of us took on tasks that challenged us while also leaning into our existing skills. There were many learning curves and failures, but the group remained supportive during difficult moments. At the same time we allowed each other the space to struggle, learn independently, and gradually progress. This balance between collaboration and individual problem solving strengthened the overall working dynamic. Technical Process Traces. During the previous week of the Extended Intelligences course we worked with the OpenAI Agent Builder, which strongly influenced our desire to incorporate agents into this project. I was particularly interested in this direction, and as a group we wanted to connect a Raspberry Pi Pico sensor to an MCP and link it to an OpenAI agent. However, creating MCPs from a physical sensor and successfully connecting them to an agent proved far more difficult without direct guidance from the professors who taught the Extended Intelligences course. We spent many hours attempting to resolve these issues, but complications with IAAC WiFi and Cloudflare prevented us from fully implementing the system. Although this was frustrating, we ultimately had to accept the limitation due to time constraints. Technical Process Traces. In the end, I feel that we made several compromises that caused us to drift away from the project\u2019s original intention. However, this process was an important learning experience. Despite the challenges, we accomplished a significant amount and gained valuable technical and conceptual insight. In hindsight, starting with a smaller and more focused scope would have allowed us to build up complexity gradually rather than beginning with an ambitious system that ultimately had to be simplified.
