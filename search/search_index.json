TO SHAPE THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE TO SHAPE THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE - Creating moments that often go unnoticed yet define the quality of our lives - experiences that linger - a space, a texture, or an interaction that feels personal and alive - \u201cTo make invisible data visible again.\u201d \ud83d\udfe3 Project 2 \u2014 Algorithmic Mood Predictor \u00b6 Description: A playful Google Sheets experiment that predicts your emotional state based on your daily inputs (sleep, caffeine, steps, screen time, cycle phase, and mood word). Goal: To show how much emotional power we give to algorithms. Tools: Google Sheets, Formulas, Conditional Logic, Data Visualization \ud83d\udfe2 Project 3 \u2014 Digital Confession Archive \u00b6 Idea: Collected confessions from strangers were printed and scattered around Barcelona \u2014 reconnecting the digital and physical layers of data. Outcome: A growing physical archive of digital intimacy. \ud83e\udded Reflection \u00b6 Through these prototypes, I explored how digital systems shape emotional transparency \u2014 asking where the line between comfort and exposure lies. Next, I aim to connect this to wearable design and sensor-based interaction for my master project.
